                <br>Tast Check
                <br>It is a web page that checks in on you every half hour to see if you're still working on your homework.
                <br>You tell it how much work you have left, and it will check in on you and hold you accountable.
                <br>You will get a penalty if you do not tell it, you were productive or if it detects a task is open that you should not be with working on homework. (YouTube, Facebook, Amazon)
                <br>Unlike <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/">Forest</a>,
                <br>Our product does not require a mobile device to keep you on task and is more aggressive to keep you on task.

                    It Is not for sharing your profiles but for you to access your own pages.
                    <br>Imagine if the sites from your favorites bar or folders were all neatly in one website that showed them all and you could search through them.
