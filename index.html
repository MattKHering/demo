                <br>It is a web page that checks in on you every half hour to see if you're still working on your homework.
                <br>You tell it how much work you have left, and it will check in on you and hold you accountable.
                <br>You will get a penalty if you do not tell it, you were productive or if it detects a task is open that you should not be with working on homework. (YouTube, Facebook, Amazon)
                <br>Unlike <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/">Forest</a>,
                <br>Our product does not require a mobile device to keep you on task and is more aggressive to keep you on task.
