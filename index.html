    <p>For students 
    <br>Who do not stay on task. 
    <br>Tast Check 
    <br>It is a web page that checks in on you every half hour to see if you're still working on your homework. 
    You tell it how much work you have left, and it will check in on you and hold you accountable. You will get a penalty if you do not tell it, you were productive or if it detects a task is open that you should not be with working on homework. (YouTube, Facebook, Amazon) 
    <br>Unlike Forest <https://www.forestapp.cc/>, 
    <br>Our product does not require a mobile device to keep you on task and is more aggressive to keep you on task. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>For students 
    <br>Who do not drink enough water.
    <br>Water Watcher 
    <br>It is a site that encourages you to stay hydrated.  
    <br>Unlike WaterMinder <https://waterminder.com>, 
    <br>Water Watcher is a web page that plays a chime every hour to remind you to drink water. You should. 
    It does not require an Apple or Android device to function and can run in the background of your browser. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>For students 
    <br>Who need to quickly access without multiple clicks or portal. 
    <br>My Quick Links 
    <br>It is a secure place to put any links to site that you need quick access to.  
    <br>Unlike Myurls<https://myurls.co/>, 
    <br>My Quick Links is a personal web page that allows you to add your own link to places you want to go. 
     It Is not for sharing your profiles but for you to access your own pages. 
     Imagine if your Favorites tab sites were all neatly in one website that showed them all and you could search through them. </p>
